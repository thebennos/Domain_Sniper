This is a PHP script that will ensure that you are able to purchase your domain name before anyone else.

//////////////////
FEATURES
/////////////////

1. Automatically checks to see if a domain name or a group of domain names is available for purchase (via Cron).
2. Automatically purchases the domain(s) if set to do so.

//////////////////
TO-DO
/////////////////

1. Find out how to add funds to account (since registrar's API doesn't offer that functionality).
2. Find out how to add funds without hard-coding personal information.
3. Get it to work with more than just Dynadot's API.

Notes

1. Frontend is by no means permanent. I borrowed it from another site, and edited it to work for my backend. 
It's not my work at all, just making that clear. I'm no artist ;)
